# Movie-Ticket-Management-System

A Java-based project, the Movie Ticket Management System provides an easy-to-use interface for booking movie tickets. Customers can browse the ticket type, pick particular showtimes, select block, reserve seats, and after payment get a printed ticket for the film of their choice. This system guarantees a convenient and safe experience with features like seat selection, and booking history tracking.
